"Various technologies described herein pertain to configuring an access
     point in a local network for operation in a community Wi-Fi network. The
     community Wi-Fi network includes access points in differing local
     networks that share respective network bandwidth capacities with member
     computing devices of the community Wi-Fi network. A request to join the
     access point to the community Wi-Fi network is transmitted from the
     access point to a community aggregation system. Responsive to the
     request, the community aggregation system transmits a firmware update to
     the access point. The access point installs the firmware update in memory
     of the access point. Moreover, responsive to installation of the firmware
     update, the access point can share network bandwidth capacity with the
     member computing devices of the community Wi-Fi network. Further, the
     community aggregation system supports transparent handoffs between access
     points in to the community Wi-Fi network."
"A first micro-base station may be configured initiate communications with
     a plurality of mobile devices, where each mobile device is associated
     with an access ID stored in the first micro-base station. The access ID
     may be a MAC ID. The first micro-base station may determine that a
     handover trigger has occurred. The first micro-base station may handover
     communications with at least one of the mobile devices to a second
     micro-base station by sending a list of access IDs to the second
     micro-base station. The access IDs sent by the first micro-base station
     may be a subset of the access IDs of mobile devices communicating with
     the first micro-base station. The second micro-base station receiving the
     list may then takeover communications with the at least one mobile device
     using the access IDs in the list. The handover may be transparent to the
     mobile devices that are handed over."
"The subject matter described herein relates to data communication in
     wireless communication systems. The device determines availability of
     scheduled serving cell before data communication and informs a device the
     determined availability of the scheduled serving cell. Depending upon the
     determined availability, the device is controlled to perform the data
     communication on the scheduled serving cell or another available serving
     cell. In this way, the unfinished data communication, for example,
     retransmission of a data block in an uplink or downlink HARQ process can
     be continued on an available serving cell, whereby avoiding large
     transmission delay and throughput loss in the wireless communication
     system."
"The disclosed technology is generally directed to device certification in
     an IoT environment. For example, such technology is usable in managing
     relationships between IoT devices and an IoT Hub. In one example of the
     technology, an IoT Hub receives a registration request. Next, the IoT Hub
     sends a registration verification to the IoT device. Next, the IoT Hub
     receives a ping from the IoT device. Next, the IoT Hub sends a response
     to the ping to the IoT device. Next, the IoT Hub receives verification of
     a validation of a log file output by a device based on running a
     plurality of unit tests on a device with a software development kit.
     Next, the IoT Hub automatically sends code to the IoT device."
"Systems and methods for providing targeted event notifications to
     subscribers are disclosed. In an example embodiment, events may be
     received from a publisher. The events may be categorized into a plurality
     of topics. The events may be distributed among brokers to process a topic
     selected from the plurality of topics based on the events. Further, it
     may be determined whether the topic exists in a list of topics handled by
     the brokers. Authentication credentials of the publisher may be
     validated, based on the determination. Based on the validation, queues of
     the events may be formed based on an order of receipt of the events. The
     events present in the queues may be filtered based on subscriptions of
     the events. For the fileted events, targeted even notifications may be
     forwarded to the subscribers."
"Embodiments provide an API that provides metadata about a cloud service's
     endpoints in response to a single query. This allows a cloud service to
     advertise each of its endpoints through a common endpoint. The common
     endpoint may be present in each of a plurality of cloud services, thereby
     allowing each cloud service automatically discover metadata for other
     cloud services."
"Variety of approaches to provide an autonomous governor in a distributed
     system for preserving a shared resource are described. A hosted service
     initiates operations to provide the autonomous governor upon determining
     the shared resource to be managed. An initial lease count is designated
     to the shared resource. The initial lease count corresponds to an
     estimated capacity of the shared resource. Next, an assigned lease count
     is determined by incrementing or decrementing the initial lease count
     based on a detected actual capacity of the shared resource. Upon
     detecting a steady state of the assigned lease count, the assigned lease
     count is incremented to determine whether the actual capacity of the
     shared resource is increased."
"Routing of communications to group member(s) where group membership is
     identified by physical status. A computing system detects a communication
     that identifies targets of the communication at least in part by physical
     status. The system responds by identifying at least partial membership in
     a group that is identified by the physical status identified in the
     communication, and then dispatching the communication to at least one
     member of the members of that group. The identity of the members of the
     group may change dynamically as the physical status of particular
     physical entities changes over time. Accordingly, a user may communicate
     to individuals based on physical status, rather than identify any
     particular individual or status group. The communication may be directed
     to all members of the group. Alternatively, the communication may be
     initially directed towards a subset of the group, with the communication
     being conditionally later broadened."
"A system for identifying attributes associated with content of an e-mail
     message and alerting a user includes a client device programmed to allow
     a user to create an e-mail message including at least one recipient and a
     message content, a server programmed to check an attribute of the e-mail
     message, and to send the e-mail message, and one or more information
     stores in communication with the server, the information stores including
     information about the e-mail message. The server is programmed to query
     the information stores to obtain information about the e-mail message as
     the message is being composed by the user, and the server sends a mail
     tip to the client regarding the e-mail message. The client is programmed
     to provide the mail tip to the user, the mail tip being formatted and
     positioned by the client so that it is integrated within a header section
     of the e-mail message."
"Messages are collected and processed to determine topic identifiers that
     correspond to discussion groups. Queries are received and multiple
     discussion groups that are relevant to the query are determined based on
     the messages that are associated with the discussion groups and the topic
     identifiers associated with the discussion groups. The relevant
     discussion groups are ranked using a group preference model that
     simulates the behavior of a hypothetical seeker that considers discussion
     groups by selecting a message author who is an authority in a particular
     group, and exploring the discussion groups that are preferred by the
     selected author. The behavior of the seeker is simulated using a
     stationary Markov process and is used to generate a probability
     distribution that is used to rank the relevant discussion groups. The
     ranked relevant discussion groups are provided in response to the query."
"Latency in responding to queries directed to geographically distributed
     data can be reduced by allocating individual steps, of a multi-step
     compute operation requested by the query, among the geographically
     distributed computing devices so as to reduce the duration of shuffling
     of intermediate data among such devices, and, additionally, by
     pre-moving, prior to the receipt of the query, portions of the
     distributed data that are input to a first step of the multistep compute
     operation, to, again, reduce the duration of the exchange of intermediate
     data. The pre-moving of input data occurring, and the adaptive allocation
     of intermediate steps, are prioritized for high-value data sets.
     Additionally, a threshold increase in a quantity of data exchanged across
     network communications can be established to avoid incurring network
     communication usage without an attendant gain in latency reduction."
"Technologies are described for performing equation-based rate control
     using delay. For example, an observed network data rate and a network
     delay can be obtained for a network communication. A target network data
     rate can be calculated using the observed network data rate and the
     network delay. The target network data rate is calculated using an
     equation-based approach. For example, the equation-based rate control can
     set the target network data rate to a value that is directly proportional
     to the observed network data rate and inversely related to the network
     delay. The target network data rate is used to set the bitrate for the
     network communication."
"A hierarchical network analytics system operated by a computing device or
     system is described. In some example techniques, the analytics system may
     determine results of a plurality of first level analyses each based at
     least in part on results of a respective plurality of data queries that
     return respective subsets of a plurality of types of network data. The
     analytics system may determine a result of a second level analysis based
     at least in part on results of the plurality of first level analyses."

     binding includes a mapping between the first cryptlet and at least one of
     a smart contract or another cryptlet. A binding identification is
     associated with the cryptlet binding. An output is received from the
     first cryptlet, such that the output is at least one of encrypted or
     signed by the cryptlet private key, and such that the output is signed by
     an enclave private key. A cryptlet identity is generated for the first

"Examples described herein improve the way in which a transcript is
     generated and displayed so that the context of a conversation taking
     place during a meeting or another type of collaboration event can be
     understood by a person that reviews the transcript (e.g., reads or
     browses through the transcript). The techniques described herein use
     voice recognition to identify a user that is speaking during the meeting.
     Accordingly, when the speech of the user is converted to text for the
     transcript, the text can be attributed to the identified user. The
     techniques described herein further configure a graphical user interface
     layout, in which the transcript can be displayed. The graphical user
     interface layout enables users to better understand the context of a
     conversation that takes place during a meeting."
"Tools and techniques are described to render oversize glyphs in a
     monospace grid. Glyph rendering algorithms collect changed cells, collect
     affected cells based on overlap, clear certain affected cells, and redraw
     only specified cells. By reducing the number of cells whose glyphs are
     redrawn in response a text edit, algorithms permit faster execution even
     when rendering is done by a script rather than precompiled code.
     Algorithmic advances also permit faster display frame rates, and help
     preserve battery power. Grids may be numbered, and traversed, in
     different ways. Oversize glyphs may include underscores, ligatures,
     mathematical symbols, emojis, kanji, accented characters in various
     natural languages, and wide or tall text characters which extend beyond
     the display space of a single cell. Glyph rendering may provide user
     interface updates in browsers, shells, terminal emulators, and other
     programs."

     organizer is able to select multiple proposed meeting times for the
     meeting. The attendees are presented with multiple proposed meeting times
     in the context of the attendee's calendar. The user interface within the
     meeting request is optimized to provide the user with a visual
     demonstration of the proposed meeting times, thereby providing the

     in any system supporting MZMs."
"The automatic formulation of a plan for concurrent movement of physical
     entities within a physical space. A physical graph is used to formulate
     such a plan. The physical graph represents multiple physical entities
     that have been sensed in a physical space over time. A plan is then
     formulated based on an evaluation of that physical graph. Such plans are
     enabled by the semantic understanding of the physical space and its
     contents that the physical graph provides. The plan honors physical
     constraints of the physical space, and physical constraints of the
     physical entities that are moving within that physical space. The plan
     may be further orchestrated by communicating with the physical entities
     to provide instructions for movement. Then, movement is monitored to
     determine if the plan is being complied with. If the plan is not being
     complied with, further communications are made and/or an alternative plan
     is automatically constructed."
"Systems and methods for generating and handling tokenized links pointing

"Linking of a child table to a parent table in a database system. For a
     given parent table row, an expression associated with the particular row
     is identified. The expression may be a semantic expression that comprises
     something different than or more than an equals expression or a contains
     expression. The expression might also take as input a field of the parent
     table other than the primary key of the parent table. For each of
     multiple (and potentially all) rows of a child table, the expression is
     evaluated against a foreign key of the corresponding row of the child
     table. If the foreign key matches the expression, an association is
     created, and perhaps saved, between the foreign key and the particular
     row of the parent table. The expressions may differ even down to the
     granularity of a single row in the parent table, thereby enabling perhaps
     custom per-row expressions."

     shadow wall protrudes outwardly from the surface of a substrate to define
     an adjacent shadow region in which deposition is prevented due to the
     shadow wall inhibiting the passage of the angled deposition beam. Hence,
     deposition will not occur on a surface portion of a semiconductor
     structure within the shadow region. Shadow walls can thus be used to
     achieve selective patterning of semiconductor structures. The shadow

"Techniques for using recruiter review data to create training, validation
     and test sets for automated sourcing are described. An example system
     obtains sample suggested candidate member profiles and sample search
     result member profiles in an online system. The system identifies unique
     pairs of member profiles, each pair consisting of one of the suggested
     candidate profiles and one of the search result profiles. Additionally,
     the system generates a label for each of the unique pairs of profiles.
     The label is generated using a score generated from log information of
     the online system, the log information including historical records of
     searcher feedback regarding members of the online system, the score being
     higher if the searcher accepted the sample search result member profile
     in a search session. Furthermore, the system inputs the labels into a
     machine learning algorithm to train a combined ranking model that outputs
     ranking scores for search result member profiles."

     for maintaining the graph database storing a graph, wherein the graph
     includes a set of nodes, a set of edges between pairs of nodes in the set
     of nodes, and a set of predicates. When a write query of the graph
     database is received, the system uses one or more of the processes to
     process the write query by using a schema of the graph database to
     validate the write query. Next, the system transmits the validated write

"Techniques for using digital entity correlation to generate a composite
     knowledge graph from constituent graphs. In an aspect, digital attribute
     values associated with primary entities may be encoded into primitives,
     e.g., using a multi-resolution encoding scheme. A pairs graph may be
     constructed, based on seed pairs calculated from correlating encoded
     primitives, and further expanded to include subjects and objects of the
     seed pairs, as well as pairs connected to relationship entities. A
     similarity metric is computed for each candidate pair to determine
     whether a match exists. The similarity metric may be based on summing a
     weighted landing probability over all primitives associated directly or
     indirectly with each candidate pair. By incorporating primitive matches
     from not only the candidate pair but also from pairs surrounding the
     candidate pair, entity matching may be efficiently implemented on a
     holistic basis."

     includes multiple nodes that maintain user records (e.g., sharded by user
     identifier) storing events associated with the members and that also
     maintain separate event status tables to identify statuses of selected
     events. For example, an event status table may store statuses of root
     events and/or other ancestor events from which a given subsequent event
     may inherit or derive a status. An event status may reflect a quality or
     characteristic of the event (e.g., spam, low quality, language of the
     event), a status of the associated user (e.g., fame, level of influence),
     etc."

     wide variety of views on the data set, and corresponding controls
     appropriate for that view. The level of control over data preparation is
     even further enhanced by a selection control and navigation control. The
     selection control allows a portion of the view to be selected, which
     would in turn affect the view(s) displayed in one or more other user
     interface components. The navigation control causes the user interface
     components to display views on the data set as that data set existed at
     various prior stages in data preparation. The selection control remains
     active even when viewing prior stages of the data set."
"An exemplary computing environment having a DNN module can maintain one
     or more bandwidth throttling mechanisms. Illustratively, a first
     throttling mechanism can specify the number of cycles to wait between

     Illustratively, a second throttling mechanism can be a transaction count
     limiter that operatively sets a threshold of a number of transactions to
     be processed during a given transaction sequence and limits the number of
     transactions such as multiple transactions in flight to not exceed the
     set threshold. In an illustrative operation, in executing these two
     exemplary calculated throttling parameters, the average bandwidth usage
     and the peak bandwidth usage can be limited. Operatively, with this

     CCT system collects the configuration information of the device and sends
     the collected configuration information to the CCT server. If the second
     configuration source can support the configuration information of the
     current configuration source, the CCT server requests that the device
     transfer control of the configuration information from the current

     efficient adoption and use by end users and application developers. From
     an end user's standpoint, the clipboard component provides a new user
     experience which is easy for the users to discover, learn and use, due,
     in part, to the use of ergonomic control mechanisms for activating paste
     and copy operations. From a developer's standpoint, the clipboard
     component provides a way of allowing existing legacy applications to
     interact with a multi-item clipboard store, even though these
     applications were not originally created to provide that type of
     interaction. The clipboard component can also, upon instruction by a

     Selection may only occur when strokes meet a threshold condition such as
     having a particular direction (e.g., perpendicular to a direction for
     scrolling the surface) or moving a minimal distance. Strokes in a
     scrolling direction (e.g., horizontal) may scroll the surface in that

"Replicating a primary application cache that serves a primary application
     on one network node into a secondary application cache that serves a
     secondary application on a second network node. Cache portions that are
     within the primary application cache are identified, and then identifiers
     (but not the cache portions) are transferred to the second network node.
     Once these identifiers are received, the cache portions that they
     identify may then be retrieved into the secondary application caches.
     This process may be repeatedly performed such that the secondary
     application cache moves towards the same state as the primary application
     cache though the state of the primary application cache also changes as
     the primary application operates by receiving read and write requests."

     notifications in a privileged manner compared to the second-type
     notifications. For instance, the technique presents content associated
     with each first-type notification in an allocated window that appears in
     positional association with a person indicator, where that person
     indicator identifies the person who sent the first-type notification; the
     technique presents each second-type notification in a different manner.
     In some implementations, an application developer who designs a custom
     first-type notification is given authority to draw within the allocated
     window that is used to present the custom first-type notification in a
     manner specified by the application developer."

     used to detect anomalies or attacks, which in turn informs mitigation
     actions. The local inspection may be performed by
     reconfigurable/reprogrammable ""smart"" network interfaces (NICs) at each

"Computational tasks are mapped with computational locations in a
     distributed system such as a cloud computing environment. Mapping does
     not rely on workload estimates. Instead, tasks whose prerequisite tasks
     or other preconditions are determined to be mutually exclusive are
     co-located, while other tasks are mapped to different locations than one
     another. Locations are servers, processor cores, virtual machines,
     applications, or computational processes, for example. Mutual exclusivity
     may be determined by detecting that preconditions require different
     values of a shared variable in order to be satisfied, for example, or
     determining that preconditions correspond to different branches of a
     conditional programming statement. A satisfiability engine may also
     provide a satisfiability determination. Co-located tasks may also be
     batched, for improved execution performance. Co-location based on mutual
     exclusivity may result in fewer operations to save and restore task
     state, fewer cache misses, greater co-allocation of computational
     resources by the tasks, and easier debugging."

"A priority-based scheduling and execution of threads may enable the
     completion of higher-priority tasks above lower-priority tasks.
     Occasionally, a high-priority thread may request a resource that has
     already been reserved by a low-priority thread, and the higher-priority
     thread may be blocked until the low-priority thread relinquishes the
     reservation. Such prioritization may be acceptable if the low-priority
     thread is able to execute comparatively unimpeded, but in some scenarios,
     the low-priority thread may execute at a lower priority than a
     medium-priority thread that also has a lower priority than the
     high-priority thread. In this scenario, the medium-priority thread is
     effectively but incorrectly prioritized above the high-priority thread.
     Instead, upon detecting this scenario, the device may temporarily elevate
     the priority of the lower-priority thread over the priority of the
     medium-priority thread until the lower-priority thread relinquishes the
     resource, thereby reducing the waiting period of the high-priority thread
     for the requested resource."

"A ""Database Confidentiality System"" provides various techniques for using
     server-side trusted computing in combination with configurable type
     metadata and user- or system-definable rules associated with individual

     database field. Metadata includes a domain, method of encryption, and a
     pointer to an encryption key used to encrypt the data in the
     corresponding field. The rules define one or more operations allowed on
     the corresponding data types. The type metadata and rules are optionally
     integrity protected and/or encrypted to avoid unauthorized changes or
     access. Various encryption techniques (e.g., probabilistic, Paillier,
     etc.) allow some computations to be performed in an untrusted environment

     disclosure provides for query execution on at least a subset of
     designated web content, for example as specified by a user. Still further
     yet, a localized marketing system is disclosed that provides discount
     offers to users that match merchant criteria including proximity. A
     system for actively probing populations of users with different
     parameters and monitoring responses can be employed to collect data for
     identifying the best discounts and deadlines to offer to users to achieve
     desired results."
"Examples of the present disclosure describe systems and methods of
     rendering phantom results using graph queries. In aspects, a first query
     may generate a first result set. The first result set may comprise
     ordered lists (e.g., node-edge-node 3-tuples), and may be rendered as a
     graph. A second query may then be executed against the data source to
     generate a second result set. The first and second result set may be
     compared. When inconsistencies between the result sets are identified,
     various degrees of transparency may be used in the graph to indicate the
     inconsistent data."
"Methods and systems for generating tailored user interface presentations
     based on microindustry clustering. According to various embodiments, the
     system accesses a set of entity profiles and a set of member profiles.
     The system determines a set of feature vectors for each entity of the set
     of entity profiles and identifies a set of movement data representing
     changes in association of one or more members from a first entity to a
     second entity. The system generates an entity graph for the set of
     entities and the set of members. The systems generate a first set of
     clusters in the entity graph, a second set of clusters by partitioning
     one or more of the first clusters, and a set of third clusters from the
     set of second clusters, combining one or more of the second clusters."
"An electronic device is configured with a social contact group
     aggregation system that operates to identify similar groups of contacts
     that are associated with different social applications and aggregate
     those groups into a single, unified group with which the device user may
     interact. When the device user uses a social application to create or
     import a new group of social contacts, the aggregation system can apply
     one or more of various aggregation factors to determine if the new group
     matches a pre-existing group and then aggregate the new group into the
     existing group if a match is identified. The aggregation factors
     illustratively include the similarity of names between the new and an
     existing group, the degree to which social contacts in the groups are
     already linked, the similarity of profile information among members of
     the groups, and other associative factors."
"A user interface that includes components that each provide a view on the
     underlying data set, and also provide controls for editing or preparing
     the data set. The user interface components include a detail user
     interface component that displays a detail view on the data set, and
     summary user interface component(s) that each display a corresponding
     summary view on the data set. A promotion control promotes a summary view
     on the data set to a detailed view on the data set, and corresponding
     changes the controls usable in the promoted detail view. This allows the
     user to have a wide variety of views on the data set, and corresponding
     controls appropriate for that view. Thus, the user can take the most
     efficient and intuitive approach to editing or preparing the data,
     thereby allowing data preparation to be more efficient, intuitive and
     likely correct."
"A processing unit can determine multiple representations associated with
     a statement, e.g., subject or predicate representations. In some
     examples, the representations can lack representation of semantics of the
     statement. The computing device can determine a computational model of
     the statement based at least in part on the representations. The
     computing device can receive a query, e.g., via a communications
     interface. The computing device can determine at least one query
     representation, e.g., a subject, predicate, or entity representation. The
     computing device can then operate the model using the query
     representation to provide a model output. The model output can represent
     a relationship between the query representations and information in the
     model. The computing device can, e.g., transmit an indication of the
     model output via the communications interface. The computing device can
     determine mathematical relationships between subject representations and
     attribute representations for multiple statements, and determine the
     model using the relationships."
"Techniques for identifying and presenting member profiles similar to a
     source member profile are described. With some embodiments, a general
     recommendation engine is used to extract features from member profiles,
     and then store the extracted features, including any computed, derived or
     retrieved profile features, in an enhanced member profile. In real-time,
     the general recommendation engine processes client requests to identify
     member profiles similar to a source member profile by comparing select
     profile features stored in the enhanced member profile with corresponding
     profile features of the source member profile, where the comparison
     results in several similarity sub-scores that are then combined in
     accordance with directives set forth in a configuration file. Finally,
     the member profiles with the highest similarity scores corresponding with
     the user-selected member profile are selected, and in some instances,
     presented to a user."
"Applications are surfaced to a user during browsing without requiring a
     specific search by the user. The applications can be selected for
     surfacing to the user based on the network address entered into the
     address bar of a browser, the content of the page corresponding to the
     network address, or a combination thereof. Applications may be selected
     for surfacing based on a partial address entered into the address bar
     and/or based on the web page content that is currently visible in the
     browser display."
"Techniques are provided for dynamically generating content. A request for
     content about a first entity is received from a client device. In
     response to receiving the request, an identity of a second entity of the
     client device is determined. Based on the identity, attributes of the
     second entity are identified. It is determined whether the attributes
     satisfy targeting criteria of a campaign that was initiated by the first
     entity. In response to determining that the attributes satisfy the
     targeting criteria, a first number of entities that (i) share one or more
     attributes in common with the second entity and (ii) satisfy the
     targeting criteria is determined. Also, a second number of entities that
     share the one or more attributes in common with the second entity is
     determined. A ratio is calculated based on the two numbers. First content
     that specifies the ratio is sent to the client device for display."
"A method and apparatus is for implementing a conflict resolution policy.
     The method includes providing a rule set that includes a plurality of
     rules that define the conflict resolution policy. An algorithm is
     generated by decomposing each rule in the rule set into at least one
     pre-action that is to be performed on data in identified fields in first
     and second conflicting objects, at least one condition that is to be
     applied to the first and second conflicting objects, and at least one
     action that is to be performed on the identified fields in the first and
     second conflicting objects if the at least one condition is satisfied.
     The algorithm is loaded from a configuration file for execution during a
     synchronization component runtime using first and second conflicting
     objects provided by the synchronization component."
"The insertion into a data stream of collection records associated with
     multiple collections of data items in the data stream, for purposes of
     aiding in subsequent processing of the data stream by collections. Each
     collection record comprises a collection definition that does not overlap
     with the collection definition in any of the sequence of collection
     records including the collection definition of any neighboring collection
     record in the sequence of collection records. Each collection record also
     includes a data stream address range extending from the first data item
     to the last data item in the collection."
"Variety of approaches to control file hydration behavior are described. A
     filter driver initiates operations to control file hydration behavior
     upon receiving a process identifier (PID) registration from a
     synchronization engine. Upon receiving a file operation request
     associated with a placeholder file, a PID and a process name associated
     with the file operation is identified. A hydration behavior is detected
     based on the PID or the process name. A decision associated with the file
     operation request is rendered based on the hydration behavior."
"Presenting historical state associated with prior execution of an entity.
     Based on replaying segment(s) of execution of an entity based on a trace,
     embodiments could present an indication of whether a value of a code
     element is, at a first execution time point, unknown, known, previously
     known, and/or known in the future. Additionally, or alternatively,
     embodiments could present an indication of a value relied upon by
     simulated execution of a function at a second execution time point, along
     with an indication of a timing of knowledge of the value in relation to
     the second execution time point. Additionally, or alternatively,
     embodiments could present an indication that a return value of a function
     would be known if the function had executed at a third execution time
     point, or an indication that the return value would be unknown if the
     function had executed at the third execution time point."
"In a first area of a persistent memory, data is stored that defines a
     known good state that is operable to launch the computing device to the
     known good state in response to a reboot. In response to a write request
     to the first area of persistent memory, the requested write is directed
     to a second area of the persistent memory and a record of redirected
     writes to the second area of persistent memory is updated. A request is
     received to establish an update to the known good state. The updated
     known good state is operable to launch the computing device to the
     updated known good state in response to a reboot. In response to the
     request, the record is persisted such that in response to a reboot, the
     record is usable to restore the redirected writes, thereby launching the
     computing device to the updated known good state."
"The disclosed technology adjusts hardware settings to map preferences
     consistently of a user experience across multiple hardware devices,
     despite there being different hardware capabilities and performance
     parameters among the different devices. A hardware settings translation
     engine receives a reference hardware setting of a reference computing
     device, a set of reference hardware performance parameter values, and a
     set of target hardware performance parameter values. The hardware
     settings translation engine then maps the set of target hardware
     performance parameter values to the set of reference hardware performance
     parameter values to yield a hardware adjustment map. The hardware
     settings translation engine determines the target hardware setting based
     on the reference hardware adjustment map and the reference hardware
     setting. The hardware settings translation engine sets the target
     hardware to the target hardware setting."
"Some computing devices have limited resources such as, for example,
     battery power. When a user ceases to interact with an application,
     execution of the application can be moved to background and the
     application can be paused. During the time period in which the
     application is paused, the application consumes no CPU cycles because
     executing managed threads of the paused application are stopped, and
     native threads are prevented from running using asynchronous procedure
     calls."
"The subject disclosure is directed towards a technology for efficiently
     emulating program code that is protected by one or more various code
     virtualization techniques to detect the presence of malware. An emulation
     engine emulates a program containing a mix of native code, custom (e.g.,
     virtualized obfuscated) code, and at least one emulator and/or
     interpreter that understands the custom code, by building a custom
     emulation component that is built by detecting and analyzing the internal
     emulator or interpreter. The custom emulation component may access a
     translation table built from the analysis, and also may simplify a
     plurality of instructions in the program into a lesser number of
     instructions in an intermediate language used for emulation."
"Efficient instruction processing for sparse data includes extensions to a
     processor pipeline to identify zero-optimizable instructions that include
     at least one zero input operand, and bypass the execute stage of the
     processor pipeline, determining the result of the operation without
     executing the instruction. When possible, the extensions also bypass the
     writeback stage of the processor pipeline."
"Various methods and systems for generating an idempotent workflow are
     described herein. In one example, a method includes detecting distributed
     code and identifying a boundary function in the distributed code. The
     method can also include separating the boundary function into a
     transition function, a non-idempotent function, and a reversion function.
     Additionally, the method can include transforming the non-idempotent
     function into an idempotent function by generating a flag corresponding
     to the non-idempotent function, wherein the flag indicates if the
     non-idempotent function has been executed. Furthermore, the method can
     include combining the transition function, the idempotent function, and
     the reversion function to form the idempotent workflow."
"A first client computing device, including a display and a processor. The
     processor may execute a distributed source code authoring management
     system client configured to communicate with a codebase host server. The
     processor may output a graphical user interface (GUI) of the distributed
     source code authoring management system client and may receive a first
     edit to a code file in an editor window included in the GUI. The editor
     window may provide real-time mark-up of the code file. In response to the
     first edit, the processor may transmit change set information including
     the first edit to a codebase host server. The processor may receive, from
     the codebase host server, a first conflict notification indicating that
     the first edit and a second edit to the code file have a pending merge
     conflict. The processor may output the first conflict notification to the
     display for display in the editor window."
"Examples are disclosed herein that relate to updating stylus firmware.
     One example provides a method of performing a stylus firmware upgrade in
     an interactive display system including a display and a stylus comprising
     sending, from the display, a signal to the stylus causing the stylus to
     enter a listen mode, while the stylus operates in the listen mode,
     sending, from the display, a firmware upgrade notification to the stylus
     configured for receipt by the listen mode, receiving, at the display, a
     reply to the firmware upgrade notification from the stylus, determining,
     at the display, whether the reply was received within a predetermined
     time range, and, responsive to determining that the reply was received
     within the predetermined time range, initiating transfer of a firmware
     update to the stylus if a newer firmware version is available."
"An execution environment in a computer system provides dynamic data and
     compute resources elasticity for user code to improve execution
     efficiency. The execution environment translates the user code into a
     runtime agnostic representation with a set of tasks. For each task, the
     execution environment determines a level of concurrency for executing the
     task based on the size of the set of input data for the task, the amount
     of compute resources available at the time of invocation of the task, and
     any context-sensitive heuristics provided by the user code."
"Examples of the disclosure provide a system and method for receiving a
     component at a design surface, the component representing a user
     interface element of an application. A selection of the component is
     received and a selection of at least a portion of a first target
     component is detected. Based on the selection of the first target
     component, a first property of the first target component is determined
     to use in an expression, the expression to be dynamically evaluated at
     runtime of the component. The expression automatically generated to
     change a property of the component based on the first property of the
     first target component."

     application from one site to another site in the event of a disaster.
     Prior to coming back online the application is configured with
     information to allow it to run on the new site without having to perform
     the configuration actions after the application has come online. This
     enables a seamless experience to the user of the application while also
     reducing the associated downtime for the application."
"Non-limiting examples of the present disclosure describe automatic
     creation of a composite data object from a received drag and drop action.
     A drag and drop action is received through a user interface of a
     productivity service. The drag and drop action is analyzed, where an
     analysis comprises: evaluation of attributes of data objects of the drag
     and drop action, evaluation of a relationship between the data objects
     and a determination of user intent for the drag and drop action based on
     a placement of the first data object onto a position of the second data
     object. A group type is created that comprises an arrangement of the
     first data object and the second data object based on the analysis of the
     drag and drop action. A representation of a composite data object is
     surfaced, through the user interface, based on the created group type."
