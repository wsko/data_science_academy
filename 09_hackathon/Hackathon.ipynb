    "# Hackathon: Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "You are part of a data analytics team at a bank or insurance company. A business unit has reached out, asking for help with a business problem. They want your team to analyze company data and develop a classification model to support data-driven decisions. You'll get a problem statement, a CSV dataset, and a data dictionary to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Each team will create a Jupyter notebook that includes your code, outputs (like computed values, tables, and graphics), and markdown cells with clear explanations of your steps and findings. Make sure the notebook is easy to read and understand, even for team members who aren't familiar with Python or data science. You'll need to present your solutions, walking through the final notebook in no more than 15 minutes, leaving an additional 5 minutes for Q&A.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-step Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Import and Initial Inspection:**\n",
    "   - Start by reviewing the business problem statement to understand its value. Check out the data dictionary.\n",
    "   - Import your data into a Pandas DataFrame and take a quick look at its structure using Pandas functions.\n",
    "   - Transform the business problem into a data science problem by answering these questions (state any assumptions if you lack info):\n",
    "     - **Target Variable:** What do the 0s and 1s mean? What's the business value of predicting the target accurately?\n",
    "     - **Error Impact:** Which is costlier for the business – a false positive or a false negative? This helps in choosing the right scoring metric for your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**\n",
    "   - Dive into your data using univariate and multivariate stats and visualization techniques.\n",
    "   - The goal of EDA is to understand your data and prep for feature engineering, not to draw business insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Validation:**\n",
    "   - Check if the data aligns with business logic.\n",
    "   - Develop a strategy to handle missing data – either by removing or imputing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feature Transformation:**\n",
    "   - Transform features as needed and explain why.\n",
    "   - Consider scaling, encoding, dimensionality reduction, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Selection and Optimization:**\n",
    "   - Test a few candidate algorithms.\n",
    "   - Optimize the classification threshold if possible and explain your choice.\n",
    "   - Tune hyperparameters to boost the performance of your top model.\n",
    "   - Validate the final model by scoring it on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Select the Best Model:**\n",
    "   - Choose the model with the highest test set score.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Feature Importance:**\n",
    "   - Rank the features by their importance and share your insights. Use your best-performing model or any of the candidates for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Presentation:**\n",
    "   - Prepare a presentation (up to 15 minutes) to share your findings from steps 1–7. Use your Jupyter notebook as a visual aid.\n",
    "   - Ensure your final notebook is clean, with logically ordered code and text cells. Include clear markdown write-ups for your key findings, making it a mini-report.\n",
    "   - Use bullet points for clarity.\n",
    "   - Pre-run your notebook to generate the outputs you’ll discuss – avoid running code live to sidestep the “demo effect.”\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **General Guidelines:**\n",
    "   - There are no wrong answers, and no specific expectations for metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall.\n",
    "   - Keep it clear and concise: your notebook should clearly explain your insights and process but avoid making it overly verbose."

    "A manager at Hubbard Bank knows that bringing in new clients is much costlier than retaining existing ones. It's crucial for Hubbard to understand why clients might decide to leave and seek services elsewhere. By figuring out what customers are likely to leave, Hubbard can develop effective loyalty programs and retention strategies to keep as many customers as possible. You've been asked to help Hubbard identify the customers that are likely to leave the bank. For this purpose, you've been given a historical dataset that includes the following columns:\n",
